What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
 -One challenge I encountered is that I could not re-run my code from the terminal by pressing the up arrow to get the command. I needed to click the run button on the menu bar for VSCode.
 -I at first could not figure out why my tests were failing for the right triangle, but then I realized I had to move the right triangle test case above scalene because right triangles are scalene triangles.

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
-I think that the requirements section was clear

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
-I didn't like that the test cases did not print out what the result was from the code, so I had to figure out how to view it in order to debug.

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
-Criteria I used was that I tested each type of triangle several times with inputs I knew to be correct, as well as inputs I knew to be wrong. I also tested any incoreect inputs such as a negative length or a 0 length.
-For right triangles I tested multiple types of right triangles but also every combination of orders for 3,4,5 to see if the math would always check out no matter the order. I did a similar type of test for Isoceles.
-I knew I was done when I couldn't think of another possible input and when all the tests ran successfully.
